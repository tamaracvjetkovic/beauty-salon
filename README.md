Manager has also access to insight, including reports, earnings for specified time frames or diagrams (which you can access by clicking the button "Meni" in the top left corner).
2) CLIENT:
You can schedule your treatments by clicking the button "Zakazi tretman". You are given a list of all treatments, where you can search by type, name or/and price of the treatment. After you choose one, you can decide to choose your beautician or you can let the program automatically assign one free beautician for that role to you. Lastly, you choose one currently free appointment, by selecting date and hour. You can schedule the treatment by clicking button "Zakazi" or cancel it by pressing "Odustani". You can also go back to change something by clicking "Nazad".
On the profile window, there is a "Meni" where you can access all you previous/future treatments.
3) BEAUTICIANS:
On button "Raspored" you can see your word calendar/schedule of upcoming treatments that need to be done. On button "Izvrsi tretman" you "do" the treatment and mark it with "Done".
