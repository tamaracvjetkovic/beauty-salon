# Examples üí°

After you run the program, you can login or register. 

If you register, your profile is automatically saved as "Client". After logging-in (or after directly registering), depending on the role, you are given different options:

1) ``MANAGER``:
- you manage the whole application,
- you have the access to all data and you can add, edit or delete users, treatments and scheduled treatments or the salon informations (name, working hours etc..),
- you also have access to insight, including reports, earnings for specified time frames or diagrams (which you can access by clicking the button "Meni" in the top left corner)

2) ``CLIENT``:
- you can schedule your treatments by clicking the button "Zakazi tretman",
- you are given a list of all treatments, where you can search by type, name or/and price of the treatment,
  - after you choose one treatment, you can choose your beautician or you can let the program automatically assign one free beautician for that role to you,
  - lastly, you choose one currently free appointment, by selecting date and hour,
  - you can schedule the treatment by clicking button "Zakazi" or cancel it by pressing "Odustani",
  - you can also go back to change something by clicking "Nazad",
- on the profile window, there is a "Meni" where you can access all you previous/future treatments

3) ``BEAUTICIANS``:
- on button "Raspored" you can see your calendar/schedule of upcoming treatments that need to be done,
- on button "Izvrsi tretman" you complete the treatment and mark it with "Done"

4) ``RECEPTIONISTS``:
- with "Zakazi tretman" you can schedule a treatment for clients "online",
- you have all options that client has during scheduling a treatment,
- after clicking on "Meni", all scheduled treatments in the system are listed, where you can edit their state ("scheduled", "canceled", "done" etc..)
